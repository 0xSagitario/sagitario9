Hi everyone, this will be a very short intro.
I'm @sagitario9. I don't know how to code anything at all :) and only about to start begin my journey in to learning this.
I'm interested in collaborating on or contributing to projects involving human languages; be it learning a new language or language translation.
I can be reached on Discord #sagitario4992. Looking forward to collaborating on something awesome!
